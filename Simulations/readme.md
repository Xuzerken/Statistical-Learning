# Introduction
This part called "simulation" contains some numerical experiments in high dimensional spaces in order to gain an intuition about what high dimenion is like.

# Experiments
Some of my experiments are as follows.
## The distances between random sampled points
## The angles between random sampled points(actually vectors)
